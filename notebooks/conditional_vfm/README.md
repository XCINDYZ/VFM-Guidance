# Conditional VFM Notebooks

This directory contains notebooks demonstrating Conditional Variational Flow Matching.

## Notebooks

- **conditional_vfm_demo.ipynb**: Conditional VFM for controlled generation

## What is Conditional VFM?

Conditional VFM extends basic VFM to incorporate conditioning information, allowing control over the generation process. This enables generating samples with specific characteristics or attributes.

## Key Concepts

- **Conditional Generation**: Controlling output based on conditioning variables
- **Class-Conditional Models**: Generating samples for specific classes
- **Conditioning Embeddings**: Incorporating conditioning information into the model

## Use Cases

- Class-conditional generation
- Attribute-based generation
- Multi-modal generation with control

## Running the Notebooks

1. Ensure you have installed all dependencies (see main README)
2. Start Jupyter Notebook from the repository root
3. Navigate to this directory and open the notebook
4. Run cells sequentially
