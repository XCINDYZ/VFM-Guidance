# Basic VFM Notebooks

This directory contains notebooks demonstrating basic Variational Flow Matching concepts.

## Notebooks

- **basic_vfm_demo.ipynb**: Introduction to basic VFM with 2D toy examples

## What is Basic VFM?

Basic Variational Flow Matching learns a continuous normalizing flow that transforms a simple base distribution (e.g., standard Gaussian) into a complex target distribution. The model learns a time-dependent vector field that defines this transformation.

## Key Concepts

- **Flow Matching**: Learning the vector field that defines the transformation
- **Continuous Normalizing Flows**: ODEs that transform distributions
- **Time Embedding**: Incorporating time information into the model

## Running the Notebooks

1. Ensure you have installed all dependencies (see main README)
2. Start Jupyter Notebook from the repository root
3. Navigate to this directory and open the notebook
4. Run cells sequentially
